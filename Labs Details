Kindly, I would like to share with your kind side the report of “Telemarketing system” project
 
Business Need:
This project is initiated to build a software system for Telemarketing Section to reach tasks automation and manage complex tasks such as (distribute task, follow up), currently these tasks implemented manually which is very difficult and requires too many excel sheets, In addition there is possibility of having errors .. 
Objective:
 
The system allows creating projects of the following types (Research Surveys, Segmentation Studies, or Telemarketing Campaign). we can define start and end dates, set quotas, and distribute data equally among participating telemarketers.
 
The project would allow and facilitate the following:
 
•	Automatic distribution for GSM: Distribute the list of customer GSMs related to a Survey or a campaign.
•	Statistical reports: The system should provide statistical report to get ( Count of calls per status/ Actual percentage for completed and non-completed calls/ Quota conditions), in addition the system integrates with workforce management software to calculate each telemarketer's actual working hours, project type, and segment. This data is used to determine daily productivity.
•	Target: Calculate the target for each employee.
•	Mistake report: the system should provide to calculate mistakes & report explaining the type of mistake for each employee.
•	Evaluation: Calculate the evaluation for each employee after each project.
 
Completion VS Plan:

Plan	% Complete	Variance
46%	45%	-1%

Project scope :
 
This project initiated to : 
•	Servers preparations for hosting the system.
•	System implementation and acceptance.
•	Integration with Telemarketing workforce management system.
•	UAT.
•	Implement IS System security Compliance.
•	Go production.
 
Achieved millstones: 

Stage	Planned Date	Actual Date	Note	
Sprint 1	Requirement gathering and system analysis 	30-5-2024	30-5-2024	- 	
	System modeling and build relation database 				
	 Server preparation	30-6-2024	10-7-2024 	•	Server readiness on 27-6-2024
•	Delay reason: 
Till build and publish the application to be adhere the new policy of information security. Since developer not allowed be admin on IIS ( windows web server) and task should be done through IT side.	
					
Sprint 2	Build hybrid Auth layer which combines between (windows and token) concept 	8-7-2024	17-7-2024	Delay due to above milestone to insure readiness for the server to implement UAT
